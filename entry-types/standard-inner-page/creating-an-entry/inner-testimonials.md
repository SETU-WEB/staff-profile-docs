# Inner Testimonials

This block is used for displaying testimonials on your page. You can start by entering an optional subheading, followed by a required main heading to introduce the section. After that, you simply link the block to an already created testimonial entry, allowing the content to be pulled in automatically. This makes it easy to showcase feedback or success stories in a clean and consistent format.&#x20;
