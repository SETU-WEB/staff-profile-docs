# Inner Events Resources

The events resources block is used to display selected events pulled from the main events listing. It lets you choose specific events you want to feature on a page, ensuring only the most relevant or important ones are shown. Once configured, the block presents these chosen events in a clear and organized layout, making it easy for users to browse details and access the full event information.&#x20;
