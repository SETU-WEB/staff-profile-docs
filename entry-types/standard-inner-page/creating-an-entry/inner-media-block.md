# Inner Media Block

The **Inner Media Block** is used for importing media in video form along with a caption. First, you’ll select an image to serve as the video’s thumbnail, then insert a video link—typically from YouTube. You can also add a caption to provide context or additional details. The final output will display your chosen image with a **play button**, and when clicked, it will open and play the video.&#x20;
