# Inner Event Block Area

This Block is used for adding a small block to your page to highlight an event. It allows you to quickly display key event information, such as the title, date, or brief details, in a compact and visually distinct section. It’s a simple way to draw attention to upcoming events without taking up too much space on the page.&#x20;
