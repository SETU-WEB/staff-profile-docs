# Inner Latest Events

This block is similar to the previous one, as it displays the latest items based on the category you choose. However, instead of showing all recent entries, it specifically highlights **upcoming events** within that selected category. This ensures that only future events are shown, making it a useful tool for keeping your page current and focused on what’s ahead.&#x20;
