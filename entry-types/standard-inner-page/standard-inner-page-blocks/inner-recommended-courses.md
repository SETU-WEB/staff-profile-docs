# Inner Recommended Courses

This block is designed simply to display courses in a clean, easy-to-browse list. When a user clicks on any course in the list, they’ll be taken directly to that course’s main page. The only required input for the block is a heading, and after that you’re free to add as many courses as you’d like, giving you full flexibility over what appears in the list.&#x20;
