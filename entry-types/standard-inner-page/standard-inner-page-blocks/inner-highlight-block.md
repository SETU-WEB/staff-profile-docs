# Inner Highlight Block

The Highlight Block Toggle is used for the New–Highlight/CTA field, which includes an image, text, and a button. With this option, leaving the switcher off places the image on the right side, while turning the switcher on moves the image to the left. You can also add a body of text along with a button that links to another site or page, making it a flexible and visually engaging way to draw attention to important content.&#x20;
