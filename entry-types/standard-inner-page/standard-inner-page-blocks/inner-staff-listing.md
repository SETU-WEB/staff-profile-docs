# Inner Staff Listing

The inner staff listing block is fairly self-explanatory—it’s designed to showcase selected staff members in a clean card-style layout. Each card links directly to that staff member’s profile page when clicked, making it easy for users to explore more details. To set it up, you simply provide a required heading and then choose which staff members you’d like to feature.&#x20;
