# Inner CTA Strip Section

This block is used to display a Call to Action (CTA) strip button that links directly to an entry created specifically in the CTA Strip section of the CMS. It serves as a simple, focused way to highlight an important action or destination, ensuring users are guided to the exact CTA content you’ve set up. By selecting the corresponding CTA Strip entry, the block automatically pulls in the appropriate information and presents it as a clear, clickable button.&#x20;
