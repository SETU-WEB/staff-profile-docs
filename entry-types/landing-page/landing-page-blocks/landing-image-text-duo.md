# Landing Image Text Duo

This landing image text duo block is designed to showcase two overlapping images alongside a heading, subheading, and supporting paragraph. It creates a visually engaging layout that draws attention while providing space to introduce key information or highlight an important message. The combination of layered imagery and text makes it ideal for adding emphasis and enhancing the overall impact of a landing page section.&#x20;
