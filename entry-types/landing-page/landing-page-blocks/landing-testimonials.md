This option is very similar to the previous one, except it does not include an image and instead displays a green “U” on the card. The functionality remains largely the same, but without the visual element it feels more minimal and less engaging. Because of this, it’s not used much anymore and has largely been replaced by the more modern card style with images.&#x20;
