# Entry Types

Choosing an entry type plays an important role in determining how a webpage is structured and displayed. Each entry type comes with its own layout options, features, and intended purpose, which directly influence how content is organized on the front end. For example, a Standard Inner Page is ideal for general content, while a Landing Page is designed for more visual, high-level overviews. Redirect Pages exist solely to point users to another location, and specialized types like the News Landing Page or Event Landing Page are built to showcase dynamic listings of articles or events. Selecting the correct entry type ensures the page functions as intended and provides the best user experience.
