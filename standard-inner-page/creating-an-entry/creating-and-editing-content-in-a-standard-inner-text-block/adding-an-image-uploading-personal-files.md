# Adding an image - uploading personal files

To upload personal files, the process is very similar to uploading other content. However, you’ll need to navigate to the **About** section in the sidebar to complete the upload. Keep in mind that your file **should not exceed 4MB** in size to ensure a smooth and successful upload. You can also **edit an image** after uploading it by clicking directly on the image and then selecting the **Edit Image** button to make adjustments as needed.&#x20;
