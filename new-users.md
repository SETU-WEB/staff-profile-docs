### Setting up your staff profile URL&#x20;

When a new user signs in with their SETU account and new profile is automatically setup. For this profile to show the new user needs to setup a profile url&#x20;

The Profile URL is the first field on the detail tab of your profile&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}

* Your name with hyphens instead of spaces or dots , you can follow the format of your email address, so you have a unique URL
* For example, if your email is joe.bloggs@setu use joe-bloggs as your URL&#x20;
* The same format would apply if you have a double barrelled or tripled barrelled name e.g. joe.philip.bloggs@setu.ie use  joe-phillip-bloggs as your URL
* Once you have added a profile URL and clicked save a new "View your profile" button will appear at the top of the profile page
