## Photo Field

The photo filed is the picture that will appear on you staff profile and on your staff card wherever it is used across the site. We recommend you use a passport style picture&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/staff-photo.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;The image must be.jpg or .png file type&#x20;

&#x20; Not be larger than 9 megabytes (9MB)

&#x20;If the image is too small the quality will be poor it will be stretched and distorted.
