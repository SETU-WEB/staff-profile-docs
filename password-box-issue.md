# Password box issue

A small number of users have come across an issue where a password box below appears when they try save their profile changes and this box won't accept your password&#x20;

This is caused by your browser (usually edge) automatically filling the password field at the bottom the account tab. You don't need to put in a password as that's handled on login and that field doesn't need to be updated.&#x20;

The easiest thing to do is try another browser or else turn off password autofill in the browser you are using&#x20;
