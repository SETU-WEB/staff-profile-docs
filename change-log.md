* Version 1  -  Initial release&#x20;
* Version 1.1  -  Changed user website or blog field so it's now a link to the URL provided and outputs "view details" as the text instead of the raw link . Also added a conditional to add or remove https:// section of the link dependant on the URL structure.
* Version 1.2  -  Updated the staff courses listing so the heading is now the correct size and the courses now list correctly with a space between each course card&#x20;
