# Standard Inner Page

A standard inner page serves as the core content page within a website, providing a flexible and structured space to present information that supports the main sections of your site. It’s typically used for detailed content such as program information, department overviews, service descriptions, or any other material that doesn’t belong on the homepage but still needs clear organization and easy navigation. Inner pages often include customizable blocks—such as text sections, images, staff listings, news or event feeds, and call-to-action elements—allowing you to tailor the layout to match the purpose of the page. Overall, a standard inner page gives you a clean, consistent framework to deliver meaningful content while maintaining a cohesive look and feel throughout the site.
