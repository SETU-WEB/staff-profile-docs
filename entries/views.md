# Views

There are many ways to **customize how entries are displayed**, allowing you to tailor the view to suit your workflow. You can adjust what information is shown, rearrange columns, and apply filters to focus on the content that matters most to you. This section will guide you through the different **customization options** available and show you how to set up your view for maximum efficiency. &#x20;

## Display as Table&#x20;

Entries can be displayed in a **readable table format**, which is the preferred setting. This view organizes content into **clear columns and rows**, making it easy to scan, compare, and manage multiple pages at a glance. &#x20;

## Display as Cards&#x20;

Entries can also be displayed in a **card view**, which presents each page as an individual card rather than in a table. This layout is useful for **visually browsing content**, especially when you want a quick overview of multiple pages at once.&#x20;

## View Button&#x20;

The **View** button in the top-right corner lets you **sort entries** by different criteria and, when in **table view**, allows you to **choose which columns** are displayed. This gives you more control over how your content is organized and what information is immediately visible.&#x20;
