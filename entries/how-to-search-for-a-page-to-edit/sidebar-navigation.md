# Sidebar Navigation

## Sidebar Navigation&#x20;

On the left-hand side, you’ll find the **sidebar**, which is used to navigate through different sections of the website. At the time of writing this documentation, the site contains **over 3,300 pages**, so the sidebar makes it much easier to locate specific areas or sections. You can use it to quickly **browse**, **find**, and **edit** the pages you want without having to scroll through everything manually.&#x20;
