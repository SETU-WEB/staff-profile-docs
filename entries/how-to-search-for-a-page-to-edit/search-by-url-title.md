# Search by URL Title

Searching by URL is probably the most efficient way to search a page, it will output the exact page you want, which will eliminate most duplicates. Every Entry has a unique URL title. To get the URL title of the page you want, you copy the actual URL of the search engine you are using **but ONLY keep the section after the last forward slash.** You should also be starting in the **All Entries** section of the Sidebar Navigation. &#x20;
