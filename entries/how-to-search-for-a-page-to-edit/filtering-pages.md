# Filtering Pages

With so many pages on the site, finding the one you want to edit can seem challenging at first. There are **many ways to filter and narrow down your search**, such as using the **navigation sidebar** to browse specific sections. In this section, we’ll explore the **different methods and tools** you can use to **quickly find and edit the pages** you’re looking for, along with some **tips and tricks** to make the process more efficient.&#x20;

## All Button&#x20;

The **All** button dropdown allows users to filter and display specific types of pages. The available options are **Live**, **Pending**, **Expired**, **Disabled**, **Drafts**, and **Trashed**.

* **Live** – Pages that are currently published on the SETU website and visible to the public.
* **Pending** – Pages that are still being worked on and not yet ready for publication. (This option isn’t commonly used at the moment.)
* **Expired** – Typically used for past events or outdated pages that are no longer relevant. While some editors use this to mark old content, most simply delete such entries.
* **Disabled** – Pages that were previously live but have been turned off by the user for any reason.
* **Drafts** – Unpublished pages that editors are currently drafting or revising.
* **Trashed** – Recently deleted pages. From here, users can either restore a page or permanently remove it.&#x20;
