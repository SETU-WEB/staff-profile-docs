# Inner News Resources

The inner news resources block is designed to display selected news stories pulled from the main news listing. It allows you to choose exactly which articles you want to feature on a page, giving you control over the content being highlighted. Once configured, the block presents those chosen stories in a clear, organized layout, making it easy for users to browse and access the full news items.&#x20;
